title: Linux to OS X
---

I used Linux as my main dev machine for quite a while.  Sure I wasn't working on the greatest hardware out there but I was getting work done and making money.

## Switching to mac
The startup I was working for was a BYOC (bring your own computer) shop. There we had developers using OS X, Windows, and Linux. That created some problems. Management finally decided they wanted all developers on OS X. I ended up with a 13" Macbook Air.

### What I liked
#### External monitor support
 
They just worked. At one company I worked for every Wednesday we would all get together for an hour in the afternoon for show and tell. We would all share about some new technology that we found exciting (or better yet, that we thought would help at work) or some technique that maybe only we knew but that others might benefit from. When I was on Linux, every once in a while when my turn would come up I would plug my computer into the projector and **my whole computer would crash.** I wasn't enticing anybody else to switch to Linux in those meetings.
 

Even just the day to day hassle of using external monitors was annoying. With Linux I would get to work, plug in to my work station, open up settings, activate the external monitor, then startup `xrandr` and have to position the monitor relative to my laptop. Uh...tiring. With the mac, just plug it in and go.

#### Apps
There are way more native apps available for OS X than there are for Linux. It's not terrible, especially with many companies offering web app alternatives to desktop versions, but depending on your needs this could make using Linux a deal breaker for you. After switching to Apple hardware I appreciated being able to run Photoshop instead of Gimp, the desktop version of Evernote instead of the web app version, and the same for WeChat.

#### Hardware and battery life
This may have had more to do with going from older hardware to newer hardware regardless of the OS, but everyone knows Apple makes some great hardware.  The biggest difference I felt here was an upgrade to the trackpad and battery life.

### What I missed
#### Ports
Sure I didn't use them all all the time, but when I needed them they were there: HDMI, 4 USB, VGA, ethernet, card reader. Now I have a small container full of Thunderbolt adapters.

#### The feeling of using something unique
Everyone is on a mac or a pc. I liked being different. But as I'm getting used to using OS X more and more, I think I would find it difficult to go back.
