title: You Won't Regret Starting on Linux

When I first started to learn about programming my main computer was a 15" Macbook Pro. It was great. Big screen, nice hardware, and being a *nix OS, it was easy to get a development environment set up. But for me programming started out as a hobby, so I would just spend a few nights a week tinkering around with things.  The problem however was that at the time my wife and I were living in Taiwan and being without a television, that MBP was our only entertainment system.  I needed another computer.  At this point however I wasn't sure I wanted to shell out a bunch of money on a hobby that I might not stick with. Well, not long after, my wife's generous father was getting a new computer and he offered me his old Sony Viao. I quickly deleted Windows and put the latest Ubuntu LTS on it.

### My impressions
* Linux is great for starting out because it's **cheap**. You will more likely be able to find an old PC that runs a linux distro well enough than you will be able to find a decent mac.

* The majority of tutorials on the web are geared towards *nix systems, so having a Linux dev machine will be easier than trying to go at it on Windows.

* It will teach you about the command line and more about computers in general than if you just use a Mac or Windows machine. (I remember the first time I had to boot into the command line and use `vi` to fix some configuration I messed up that caused the GUI environment not to boot was really exciting - although of course this would not have even happened if I would have been on a Mac/Windows machine - but it was a great learning experience)

So my advice to you if you are just starting out: give Linux a shot. You will learn a lot. And whether you will continue to use it  as your main dev machine or not is up to you, but I'm pretty sure you won't regret you tried it.
